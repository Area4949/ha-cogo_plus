# Home Assistant - Support for custom "zones'
Home Assistant currently only has support for circular zones (as of November 2025). Many people have voiced the desire to have support for polygon zones. I have come up a solution that provides a solution that does not require a full integration package. Not only does this solution provide support for polygons, but also provides support for polylines (coordidors), and since it was supper simple to add, support for circles - which Home Assistant also supports.
